# used Python 3.8 on Mac Mini with Pycharm evaluation edition.
# read multiple strings from user
# the first pattern 'STTTS'
# the second any length N (N >=1) at least one separated by a comma 1 4 8
# first = input('Please give your input. (consisting of the letters s and t as you like) ' / n)
# second = input('Please give your second input (consisting of numbers separated by a space.: ' / n)

# My notes.
# Hard task for me :-(
# Reason daily working languages C# (compiled language) and javascript (ecma 8).
# Had used 'simple' python code before like in Anaconda and jupiter notebooks,
# Used the line by line evaluations and that a couple years back.


# --- So I had to learn. ---
# learned from youtube (Socratia) and some Python sites and of course stackoverflow.
# the hardest was writing the unittests long time ago I did this.

# The formatting pattern was also not easy for me.
# good think I downloaded Pycharm and not try to do this in Visual studio code.
# finally unit testing starting to bubble.
# The task was hard but very useful and also fun.
